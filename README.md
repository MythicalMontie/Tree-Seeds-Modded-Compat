### **Tree Seeds Modded Compat**

<span style="color: #228b22;"><strong>This is an addon resource pack for <a style="color: #228b22;" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/tree-seeds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tree Seeds</a> by Haikis! Tree Seeds is REQUIRED if you want vanilla counterparts. Without it, vanilla saplings will still be renamed but have the default texture.</strong></span>

This pack retextures saplings in hand so that they are the corresponding tree seed! For example, a red oak sapling would be renamed to a red oak acorn while in the player's hand! Saplings when placed in the world will look the same as before.

I also corrected the lang file to say the correct seed type, i.e., acorn, pit, catkin, instead of a generic seed.

_\*Please note this pack was originally made for 1.20.1. If mods have added new trees for newer versions, please let me know so I can update it!_
